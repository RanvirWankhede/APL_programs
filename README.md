Sure! Here’s a brief yet complete overview of your entire Android syllabus that you can use to revise quickly in 1 hour before your oral exam:

⸻

✅ Unit 1: Overview of Android
	•	Android: Open-source mobile OS by Google based on Linux.
	•	History: Developed by Android Inc., acquired by Google in 2005. First version released in 2008.
	•	Android Versions: Named alphabetically after desserts (e.g., Cupcake to Pie), now versioned numerically.
	•	Android OS Stack:
	•	Linux Kernel: Core system services like memory, process, power management.
	•	Native Libraries: C/C++ libraries like SQLite, WebKit, OpenGL.
	•	DVM/ART: Dalvik Virtual Machine (older), now replaced by Android Runtime (ART).
	•	Application Framework: Provides APIs for app components.
	•	Applications: Built-in apps (phone, SMS) + user apps.
	•	Activity: Single screen UI (e.g., login page).
	•	Activity Back Stack: Stack of activities. Last-in-first-out (LIFO).
	•	Process and Threads: Each app runs in its own process. Main thread = UI thread.

⸻

✅ Unit 2: Views and Layouts
	•	XML: Used to define UI layout.
	•	View Hierarchy: UI elements are Views. Views inside Views form a tree.
	•	Layouts:
	•	LinearLayout: Arranges views vertically or horizontally.
	•	RelativeLayout: Views positioned relative to each other.
	•	TableLayout: Like HTML tables.
	•	FrameLayout: Stacks views on top of each other.
	•	Sliding Layout: Used for sliding menus.
	•	Padding: Space inside the border.
	•	Margin: Space outside the border.
	•	Activity Lifecycle:
	•	onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop(), onDestroy()
	•	Fragment: Reusable portion of UI within an activity.
	•	Fragment Lifecycle: Similar to activity but has onAttach(), onCreateView(), etc.

⸻

✅ Unit 3: Intents
	•	Intent: Messaging object for communication between components.
	•	Types:
	•	Explicit: Start a specific component (e.g., new Activity).
	•	Implicit: No specific component, system finds the best match.
	•	Intent Usage: Start activities, services, send data, etc.
	•	Examples:
	•	Telephony: Make a call using Intent.ACTION_CALL.
	•	SMS: Intent.ACTION_SENDTO with URI “sms:”
	•	Broadcast Receiver: Responds to broadcasted messages (e.g., battery low, SMS received).

⸻

✅ Unit 4: Input Controls & Dialogs
	•	Input Controls:
	•	Buttons, TextField, Checkbox, RadioButton, ToggleButton, Spinner
	•	Event Listeners: Detects user actions (onClickListener, etc.)
	•	Event Handlers: Code that runs in response to events.
	•	Touch Mode: State where user can interact via touch.
	•	Focus Handling: Which view has user input focus.
	•	Dialogs:
	•	AlertDialog: Messages with buttons.
	•	RatingBar: Star ratings.
	•	ProgressBar: Loading indicators.
	•	Toasts: Small popup message.

⸻

✅ Unit 5: Menus, Notification & Action Bar
	•	Menus:
	•	Options Menu: Appears on pressing menu icon.
	•	Context Menu: Long press on UI element.
	•	Popup Menu: Small window next to view.
	•	Handling Menu Events: onOptionsItemSelected() or onContextItemSelected().
	•	Notifications:
	•	Built using NotificationCompat.Builder.
	•	Notification Actions: Add buttons to notification.
	•	Priority: Low, Default, High, Max.
	•	Managing/Removing: Use NotificationManager.cancel().
	•	Action Bar: Top bar with app icon, title, menu items.

⸻

✅ Unit 6: Storage & Database
	•	File Handling: Save and read from internal/external storage.
	•	SQLite:
	•	Lightweight embedded DB.
	•	Use SQLiteOpenHelper (DBHelper) to create/manage DB.
	•	Schema: Table structure.
	•	CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
	•	Cursor: Interface to read query results.
	•	Example: Insert data on button click, fetch using Cursor, show in ListView.
	•	Case Study: Firebase:
	•	Real-time database by Google.
	•	Stores and syncs data in real-time.
	•	Used for storing user data, authentication, chat apps, etc.

⸻

⏳Tips Before Oral Exam:
	•	Focus on keywords and lifecycle methods.
	•	Be ready to explain difference between Intent types, Activity vs Fragment, SQLite vs Firebase.
	•	Practice at least one real-world example for each unit (e.g., login activity, todo app, quiz app, SMS sender).
	•	Mention AndroidManifest.xml in setup-related answers.

Would you like me to prepare short notes or cue cards from this for even quicker revision?

Here’s a clear and concise explanation of the differences between the requested Android concepts — great for oral exam answers:

Explicit vs implicit intent(first line is explicit and second one is implicit)
Definition
 Directly specifies the component to start
 Specifies an action to be performed, not a component
Usage
 To start an activity or service within the same app
 To request an action from another app (e.g., camera)
Example
 Intent i = new Intent(this, SecondActivity.class);
 Intent i = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
System Decision
 No - you define the target
 Yes - system chooses the best app/component

Activity vs fragment (first line is Activity second one is fragment)
Definition
 A single screen with UI
 A part of an activity that can have its own UI
Lifecycle
 Full independent lifecycle
 Depends on the activityâ€™s lifecycle
Reusability
 Less reusable
 Highly reusable in multiple activities
Flexibility
 Less flexible for dynamic UI
 Ideal for multi-pane UI, dynamic changes
Hosting
 Standalone component
 Must be hosted inside an activity

SQLite vs Firebase (first is Sqlite and second is firebase)
Type
 Local database (offline)
 Cloud-based, real-time database
Storage
 Stores data on the device
 Stores data on Googleâ€™s servers (cloud)
Connection
 Works offline without internet
 Needs internet for syncing (supports offline cache)
Querying
 SQL-based queries (structured)
 No SQL, uses JSON tree structure
Security
 Handled locally
 Requires Firebase authentication and rules
Use Case
 Small local apps (notes, to-do)
 Real-time apps (chat, live quizzes, sync apps)

 Fragment Lifecycle (Main Stages)

You can remember these in order like this:
	1.	onAttach() – Fragment is attached to activity.
	2.	onCreate() – Initialization of fragment.
	3.	onCreateView() – Inflate the layout (UI).
	4.	onActivityCreated() – Activity and fragment views are created.
	5.	onStart() – Fragment is visible.
	6.	onResume() – Fragment is active.
	7.	onPause() – Fragment is partially off-screen.
	8.	onStop() – Fragment is no longer visible.
	9.	onDestroyView() – View resources cleaned.
	10.	onDestroy() – Final cleanup.
	11.	onDetach() – Fragment is detached from activity.
